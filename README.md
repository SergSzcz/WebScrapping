To app make working you need to enter user and password to your mail account and change type of logging into (in this case is onet.pl and SMTP with right port. You can check it with your e-mail provider)
Yet another thing, it's working locally, using PostgreSQL, so you have to provide your own credentials.
It can be easily deploy to heroku or something similar.
